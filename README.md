🚀 Hey everyone! I'm excited to share our first-semester project – an Online Learning Platform we created as a team using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's like a website where you can learn cool stuff online. Me and my teammate worked together, combining our skills to make it happen. I'm aiming to become a Full Stack Web Developer, and this project shows our teamwork and my passion for building awesome things on the web. Looking forward to more adventures in web development! 🌐💻 #WebDevelopment #TeamworkGoals
